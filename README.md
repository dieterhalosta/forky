# Forkfy

Forkify is a recepie app build during a JavaScript online course on Udemy. This app is used to find a recepie, get the ingredient list and create a shopping list. It uses an online API, JS5, Babel and Webpack.
Because it was build at the beginning of my codeing journey it's very basic and for sure it can be impoved, using NodeJs, React and so on.
